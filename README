"Hot Fuzz Control FUCK" - because I'm tired of remaking this software over and over again, a lot of names are taken so I have no idea what to pick

Will probably only work on Linux, I haven't tested this on Windows

"HOT" traverses a tree of uppercase letters, while "FUZZ" is just a fuzzy search. "HOT" runs the executable on full match

How to use this:
* `make` to get the `invoke` named pipe and the `invoke.o` binary
* Bind some key on your keyboard to run `invoke.o` with the path to `invoke` as its only argument
* Set `poetry run python run.py`, ran from the same directory where the file is, to run in the background (use `kill` to kill it, simple keyboard shortcuts will not work except for "ctrl"+"\"; if you want to make it autostart on KDE, you can invoke `generate_autostart.sh` with the path to the "same directory" mentioned above as its only argument)
* Put some modules into `modules` if you want. Uppercase letters in names of binaries will be used for "HOT"
* Press the keyboard button you've configured whenever you want to open this
* Use `/` to switch between modes
* Default Russian keymap gets converted to a default US English Colemak, you can change it in the source code of the program
