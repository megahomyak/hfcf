"Hot Fuzz Control FUCK" - because I'm tired of remaking this software over and over again, a lot of names are taken so I have no idea what to pick

This software is incredibly customized to *me*, so don't expect it to be friendly to *you*

It shows you a full screen of stats with a press of a button, and when typing on that same screen, you can invoke commands

Two modes of command search and invocation:
* "HOT" - matching only by big letters and sequentially, invoking on complete match
* "FUZZ" - fuzzy search, only manual invocation

The stats will only be visible when the mode is "HOT" and no characterrs are entered. "/" for switching modes

How to implement via GUI libraries (likely): one field for the input, list under input, overlay with stats when no input and mode is "HOT". Or maybe the input will be an overlay, not the stats. Whatever, what's gonna be easier will get implemented (probably the former)
